                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b><a href="https://topofindiarestaurant.com/">Curries and Gravies:</a></b> Indian curries are known for their depth of flavor, and Top of India offers a variety that caters to all tastes. Whether you prefer a rich, creamy Butter Chicken, a spicy Chicken Vindaloo, or a vegetarian-friendly Paneer Tikka Masala, there’s a curry for every palate. These curries are often paired with naan (soft, fluffy flatbread) or rice, both of which complement the bold flavors perfectly.</li>
                    <li><b> Tandoori Specialties:</b> The tandoor oven, a cylindrical clay oven used in traditional Indian cooking, imparts a smoky, charred flavor to meats and breads. At Top of India, dishes cooked in the tandoor are a must-try. Their <b>Chicken Tikka, Seekh Kebabs,</b> and <b>Tandoori Paneer</b> are marinated with spices and grilled to perfection, offering a crispy exterior and a juicy interior.

                    <li><b>Vegetarian Delights:</b> Vegetarian Indian food is rich in flavor and texture, offering a wide range of options for plant-based eaters. Top of India’s <b>Chana Masala</b> (chickpeas in a spicy tomato-based sauce), <b>Aloo Gobi</b> (a potato and cauliflower curry), and <b>Baingan Bharta</b> (mashed eggplant cooked with spices) are just a few examples of their mouthwatering vegetarian offerings. Whether you’re a vegetarian or not, you’ll find these dishes to be incredibly flavorful and satisfying.</li>
                    <li><b>Indian Street Food and Appetizers:</b> Indian street food is an essential part of the cuisine, offering bold, tangy, and spicy flavors in every bite. Top of India’s appetizers like <b>Samosas</b>, <b>Pakoras</b>, and <b>Pani Puri</b> offer a great start to your meal. The Samosas (crispy pastry filled with spiced potatoes and peas) and <b>Onion Bhajis</b> (fried fritters) are particularly popular, as they perfectly capture the essence of Indian street food.</li>
                    <li><b>Sweets and Desserts:</b> No Indian meal is complete without a touch of sweetness, and Top of India’s selection of desserts does not disappoint. <b>Gulab Jamun</b>, soft dough balls soaked in rose-scented syrup, and <b>Kheer</b>, a sweet, creamy rice pudding flavored with cardamom and saffron, are two of the most beloved Indian desserts.
